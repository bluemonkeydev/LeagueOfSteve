NCAA Basketball Bracket Android Application / RickRoll

Background
==========
A guy at our office runs an NCAA basketball pool.  I thought it would be funny to create an Android app to RickRoll another guy.  This apps does just that.  Can be used in conjunction with LeaugeOfSteveRanking to automate the pull of an CBS Sports bracket pool.  Could easily be modified to use anything.

Usage
=====
There is ONE configuration you can make, in the MainActivity class, adjust the URL to your S3 path to the rankings XML file.

Should work as-is by using my S3 XML.
